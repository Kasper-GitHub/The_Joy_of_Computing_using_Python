# Legendre's Three-Square Theorem:
# A positive integer m can be expressed as the sum of three squares
# (i.e., m = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 for some integers p, q, r)
# if and only if m is not of the form:
#
# m = 4^a * (8b + 7)
#
# where a and b are non-negative integers.
#
# Explanation of the modulo 8 condition:
# - Any perfect square is congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8.
# - Therefore, the sum of three squares can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 modulo 8.
# - It is impossible for three squares to sum to 7 modulo 8.
#
# Steps to apply the theorem:
# 1. Remove all factors of 4 by repeatedly dividing m by 4 (this doesn't affect whether m can be written as a sum of squares).
# 2. If the resulting value is congruent to 7 modulo 8 (i.e., m % 8 == 7),
#    m cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares â€” return False.
#
# This allows us to quickly eliminate impossible cases without looping through all square combinations.
